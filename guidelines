An Organisation in GitHub is a collection of repositories where the owner(s) can manage access to these repositories.
An Organisation’s namechange should be avoided. Doing so has  downstream impacts to other integrated components, like Artifactory, Vault, etc. Updating Organisation ownership and team structure is fairly straight  forward. Sr. TSM owns 1-N Products.  1-N Products can live in an Organisation, but all Repositories for a single Product will be tied to the same Organisation. 
 
TCO is moving towards the use of the word PRODUCT versus Application??  Michele Levin posted the change from
Application Inventory to Product Catalogue.
