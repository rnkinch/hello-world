An Organisation in GitHub is a collection of repositories where the
owner(s) can manage access to these repositories[MDW1] .
An Organisation’s namechange should be avoided.  [MDW2]  Doing so
has  downstream impacts to other
integrated components, like Artifactory, Vault, etc. Updating Organisation ownership and team structure is fairly straight
forward.
Sr. TSM owns 1-N Products.
1-N Products can live in an Organisation,
but all Repositories[MDW3]  for a
single Product
[MDW4] will be tied
to the same Organisation.



 [MDW1]Access
Groups?  Like using LDAP access
groups?  We haven’t done this but I
suppose we could offer that up.












 [MDW2]Owners
of an Org I believe can actually change the name of an Org.  I don’t believe there is any way to stop
this.












 [MDW3]May
need some clarification here about Shared Libraries and/or Services??












 [MDW4]TCO
is moving towards the use of the word PRODUCT versus Application??  Michele Levin posted the change from
Application Inventory to Product Catalogue.
